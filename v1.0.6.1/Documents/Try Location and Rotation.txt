Try Location and Rotation
Objective:
	- shows if a brick object does not overlap another when rotated or set its location. Otherwise, it doesn't.

Work flow (disregarding rotation origin, default 1,1, and brick size)
1. Get test location and rotation direction.
2. Get rotation type from test rotation direction (rotate 90 deg clockwise/counterclockwise, rotate 180 deg).
3. Replicate brick tiles of current BrickObject instance to store to temporary brick tiles variable.
4. Update x's and y's of temp tiles according to rotation type. This is the start of testing if rotating this object overlaps another.
5. Set its temporary location to check if overlaps another
6. If any of the conditions are false, then replace the current brick tiles to temp tiles.
